- 2023-30-07: The tutorial will happen on 8 October 2023 - Sunday afternoon (PM).
- 2023-14-03: The tutorial **Diffusion Models for Medical Imaging** has been ACCEPTED for [MICCAI 2023](https://conferences.miccai.org/2023/en/default.asp)!

# Outline

There has been an explosion of developments in generative models in machine learning (including Variational Auto-Encoders or VAEs, Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs, Normalizing Flows or NFs) that enable us to generate high-quality, realistic synthetic data such as high-dimensional images, volumes, or tensors. Recently a (re)newed breed of generative models, Diffusion Models have shown impressive ability in generating high-quality imaging data. Applications of diffusion models in medical image analysis are already appearing in the context of image reconstruction, denoising, anomaly detection, segmentation, generation of data, and causality.

This tutorial presents an overview of generative modelling, focusing on diffusion models (theory and learning tricks). We will discuss applications in the medical imaging field and overview existing open-ended challenges. We will also offer a session with demo and code that build upon the recently released open-source library [MONAI generative models](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/GenerativeModels).
