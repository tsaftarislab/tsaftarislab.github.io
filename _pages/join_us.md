If you wish the join the group as a PhD student or a postdoc, read below about open positions and funding opportunities.

## Current opportunities {#opportunities}

* **PostDoc on Causal Representation Learning from Rare Data (CLOSING SOON, 20 October 2022):** We are looking for an enthusiastic postdoctoral researcher to join our team led by Prof. Sotirios Tsaftaris in a prestigious high-profile [project]([https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/5238](https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/X017680/1)) (funded by EPSRC New Horizons). Prior work in our group (Hartley & Tsaftaris, arXiv 2022 and Jegorova et al, arXiv, 2021) has shown that supervised AI models are very susceptible to spurious correlation even when it is extremely rare. We don’t know how the representations are affected, or how shortcut learning contributes, or whether this is a pure artifact of stochastic training. You will interact with Amazon Web Services, Canon Medical and visit ELLIS Units in Europe. Deadline 20 October 2022. [Apply now here:](https://elxw.fa.em3.oraclecloud.com/hcmUI/CandidateExperience/en/sites/CX_1001/job/5238) 

* **Causal representation learning for robust healthcare predictions** : As part of the [Canon Medical/RAEng Grant](https://vios.science/projects/raeng), we are looking to expand the team with a highly motivated PhD student working on disentangled representations, computer vision, and medical image analysis to start as soon as possible. Full funding and tuition fees for exceptional international candidates available too. Check the details at the [school of engineering](https://www.eng.ed.ac.uk/studying/postgraduate/research/phd/causal-representation-learning-robust-healthcare-predictions) or [FindAPhD](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/causal-representation-learning-for-robust-healthcare-predictions/?p138796) pages.

* ~~**PhD student in Causal data-driven insight and prediction in care** : Apply directly via this [FindAPhD link](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/causal-data-driven-insight-and-prediction-in-care/?p131870). Pay attention to the application instructions for this particular position.~~

* ~~**PhD student in Explainable machine learning for risk prediction in later life care** : The project aims to develop explainable machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of harms from common healthcare interventions in older people approaching the end of life. Project with [Advanced Care Research Centre](https://www.ed.ac.uk/usher/advanced-care-research-centre). Check [here](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/explainable-machine-learning-for-risk-prediction-in-later-life-care/?p135446) for details.~~

* **PhD students for the CDT in Biomedical AI:** Prof. Tsaftaris is listed as a supervisor for the CDT in biomedical informatics so interested students that are interested in the intersection of healthcare and AI are more than welcome to contact them with an expression of interest before application. Information to apply is [here](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/biomedical-ai/apply). 

* **PhD students for ELLIS:** Prof. Tsaftaris as a Fellow for ELLIS welcomes applications from interested candidates as part of this unique in the world PhD program. You are more than welcome to contact Sotos with an expression of interest but first review carefully the application page [here](https://ellis.eu/news/ellis-phd-program-call-for-applications-2022). Note the deadline is Nov 15 2022. 

* **Alan Turing Institute:** As an affiliated supervisor with the Alan Turing
  Institute, and a Turing Fellow, Sotos can also supervise
  students interested in joining this prestigious UK institution. If you want to
  bridge machine learning and computer vision with applications in the life and
  biological sciences, and you have a strong profile, see the
  [Alan Turing Institute website](https://turing.ac.uk) on how to apply and also
  drop Sotos an email with a CV and description of your interests.
  
## General information for PhD students {#information}
* We welcome applications from outstanding and ambitious students, with the potential of becoming extraordinary scholars. We select unfortunately few of the applications that we receive, and the only selection criterion is excellence.
* Successful applicants have a very diverse background, including engineering, computer science, mathematics, physics, etc. Our research group is very diverse for gender, race, nationality, career ambition, etc. We strongly value the diversity in our group, and thus applicants from groups typically under-represented in academia are strongly encouraged to apply. Find here the minimum entry requirements by country.
* Being fluent in both spoken and written English is essential. We accept the following English language qualifications at the minimum grades specified:
    * IELTS Academic: total 6.5 with at least 6.0 in each component
    * TOEFL-iBT: total 92 with at least 20 in each section
    * PTE Academic: total 61 with at least 56 in each of the Communicative Skills scores
    * CAE and CPE: total 176 with at least 169 in each paper
    * Trinity ISE: ISE II with distinctions in all four components
Your English language qualification must be no more than three and a half years old from the start date of the programme you are applying to study, unless you are using IELTS, TOEFL, PTE Academic or Trinity ISE, in which case it must be no more than two years old.
* **Making Informal Enquiries Informative**: Applications [for open positions] must be submitted through the online University system. Informal enquiries (excluding questions on the application process and scholarships) can be sent by email to Prof. Tsaftaris or any of the other supervisors). Please clearly state your questions in the email and confirm that you have read this webpage. Questions on the application process and scholarships should be directed to the Postgraduate Office of the School of Engineering: EngGradOffice@ed.ac.uk. Within your enquiry, it is strongly recommended that you attach a detailed CV and the following: Details of every qualification; Academic career history; Highlight any academic success; Ranking withing your cohort (including its size); If you have published any conference or journal papers, provide links to the publication(s) and state your contribution.
* **Self-funded students**: We do accept students that are self-funded either via scholarship or own funds. Please do state this clearly upon any informal inquiry made.
