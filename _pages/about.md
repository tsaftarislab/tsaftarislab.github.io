Tsaftaris' Collaboratory is part of the Institute for Digital Communications in
The School of Engineering at The University of Edinburgh.

Our research interests are machine learning, deep learning, medical image
analysis (medical image computing), and image processing. Core research
application domains are computer aided diagnosis in medicine and computer vision
in agriculture (e.g. plant phenotyping, precision agriculture, agritech and
indoor farming).
