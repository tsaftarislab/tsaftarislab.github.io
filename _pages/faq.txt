Frequently asked questions for applying for
PhD positions in Causal AI in understanding medical images


Q. How many positions are being funded? 
Two. Canon Medical wants to partner with CHAI and as part of this partnership they will support two positions. 

Q. Are they fully funded? 
Yes one for an international student and one for home / settled status fees student. All include stipend. 

Q. I don't have background in X should I apply? 
These positions will likely require a mix of mathematical understanding (for causal AI) , computational skills and some understanding of medical imaging. We don't expect that every candidate will know everything, and they receive training. Of all these we have found mathematical understanding to be the hardest to endow if the candidate doesn't have any prior exposure to maths. 

Q. I am still uncertain if I have the right background. What should I do? 
We encourage you to apply. 

Q. Do I need to write a research proposal? 
Yes.
Add as title 
"Proposal for Causal AI in understanding medical images"" and include your understanding of causal AI and how it might help address issues in medical imaging. (Note that we are not looking for ideas here per se; we just want to see how you shape your thoughts.) Two pages will suffice.
