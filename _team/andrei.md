Andrei Dobrescu is a PhD student supervised by Prof. Tsaftaris.
The focus of his PhD is researching deep learning and computer vision algorithms
for image-based plant phenotyping.

He received a BSc Honours in Biotechnology, followed by an MSc in Systems and
Synthetic Biology, both from the University of Edinburgh. He has been fascinated
by how machines can help improve biological systems so he continued his studies
to research deep learning and computer vision. The focus of his PhD is
researching deep learning and computer vision algorithms for image-based plant
phenotyping. When you look at a plant or a crop the traits that you can visibly
see are a result of their genetics and their environment. Plant phenotyping is
effectively measuring these visible plant traits in order to help improve and
accelerate plant science and breeding.
