Andrei Dobrescu is a third year PhD student in the Tsaftaris Group. He received
a BSc Honours in Biotechnology, followed by an MSc in Systems and Synthetic
Biology, both from the University of Edinburgh. He has been fascinated by how
machines can help improve biological systems so he continued his studies to
research deep learning and computer vision. The focus of his PhD is researching
deep learning and computer vision algorithms for image-based plant phenotyping.
When you look at a plant or a crop the traits that you can visibly see are a
result of their genetics and their environment. Plant phenotyping is effectively
measuring these visible plant traits in order to help improve and accelerate
plant science and breeding.
