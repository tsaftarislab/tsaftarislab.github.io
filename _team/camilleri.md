Michael Camilleri is a Postgraduate Research Associate with the University of Dundee, collaborating closely with the VIOS group in Edinburgh. His research interests include Computer Vision, Probabilistic Modelling and general Machine Learning.

Michael obtained his PhD in Data Science from the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of Prof. Chris Williams: his thesis centred around characterising the coupled and hierarchical nature of social interactions of group-housed lab mice. This also involved a collaboration with Prof. Andrew Zissermann and the VGG group at Oxford towards tracking and behaviour recognition from video.  Prior to this he obtained an M.Sc. in Data Science (University of Edinburgh), an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (University of Edinburgh), and a B.Sc. in Communications and Computer Engineering (University of Malta).
