Dr. Chen Qin is a Lecturer in Computer Vision and Machine Learning at
Electronics and Electrical Engineering, The University of Edinburgh.

Before that, she worked as a Research Associate at Department of Computing,
Imperial College London. She obtained her Ph.D. in Computing Research from
Imperial College London in January 2020, M.Sc. in Control Science and
Engineering from Tsinghua University in July 2015, and B.Eng. in Automation from
Harbin Institute of Technology in July 2012. From July 2018 to May 2019, she
also worked at Siemens Healthineers (NJ, USA) and Huawei Technology (London, UK)
