In the UK alone, currently 7 million people live with cardiovascular disease and
this number will increase as the population ages. Under-resourced and
under-staffed healthcare systems are struggling with the rising caseload and the
large volumes of information being generated. Currently, excitement in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare is high, because of its potential to
help stem this information overload and reduce healthcare costs.

The AI paradigm fuelling this excitement heavily depends on well-curated
training data and is largely seen as a *black box*. In contrast we will:

1. learn from complex, multimodal, healthcare records with minimal supervision;
   and
2. focus on problems underpinning learning data representations optimised to
   provide a transparent base for the desired diagnoses and predictions. We will
   then translate these techniques to automated estimation of cardiac
   biomarkers, disease diagnosis, and most ambitiously, cardiac episode
   prediction, thus opening roads to preventive care.
