VIOS is expanding with new PhD students (at least 3 with fully funding available). We will have a VIOS open house online webinar on Nov 24, 1-2pm UK time (on Teams) to describe 
these positions and offer advice. To attend this webinar you have to [register](https://events.teams.microsoft.com/event/9ac6a80f-cf08-4f40-877e-ebcb73e4bc88@2e9f06b0-1669-4589-8789-10a06934dc61).  Descriptions of the positions will be made available at the [join us](/join_us/) page.
