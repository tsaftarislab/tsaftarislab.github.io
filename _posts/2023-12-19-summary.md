2023 has been a great year for VIOS.  We welcomed Steven as a new academic and Valerio has joined Nottingham. We saw students graduating (Xiao, Victor) landing excellent jobs. We continue to expand. We welcomed 5 new postdocs, 7 new PhD students (3 with Archimedes RC in Greece), 3 visitors, and 2 software engineers. We will continue to [expand](/join_us/). 
This growth has been fueled by impressive success in new grants tackling problems across several applications. From pure theory (representation learning), to computer assisted surgery, to digital research infrastructure aided by AI, to using AI for molecule design, to AI for netzero and many more.  We are extremely grateful to our collaborators and the funding agencies for the continued support.
Importantly though this success has also led to considerable research output. It is not possible to list it all, but here are some highlights: new patents with Canon, papers at ICLR, best paper awards at DART, papers to soon appear in Nature Methods and Scientific Reports and so much more.  We cannot wait to see what 2024 will bring.
